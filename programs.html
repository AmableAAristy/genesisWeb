        <p>
          Welcome to Genesis Children’s Academy of Florida for the 2024-2025
          school year! We are thrilled to have you join our community and
          appreciate the trust you place in us for your child’s education and
          well-being.

        <p>
          At Genesis Children’s Academy of Florida, we are dedicated to
          providing a nurturing and positive environment. We are a
          state-licensed preschool, and our curriculum follows the “Creative
          Curriculum” framework to foster your child’s growth and learning.
        </p>
        <p>
          We collaborate closely with various agencies, including CDS, VPK,
          the Early Learning Coalition of Miami-Dade, and Step Up for
          Students, to ensure the best resources and support for our students.
          Our commitment is to offer a safe, loving, and encouraging
          atmosphere for every child in our care.
        </p>

          We look forward to an exciting and enriching school year with you
          and your child!
