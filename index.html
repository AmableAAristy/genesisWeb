            Welcome to Genesis Children’s Academy of Florida for the 2024-2025
            school year! We are thrilled to have you join our community and

            At Genesis Children’s Academy of Florida, we are dedicated to
            providing a nurturing and positive environment. We are a
            state-licensed preschool, and our curriculum follows the “Creative
            Curriculum” framework to foster your child’s growth and learning.

          <p>
            We collaborate closely with various agencies, including CDS, VPK,
            the Early Learning Coalition of Miami-Dade, and Step Up for
            Students, to ensure the best resources and support for our students.
            Our commitment is to offer a safe, loving, and encouraging
            atmosphere for every child in our care.
          </p>
