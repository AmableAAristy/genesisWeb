          <p>
            At Genesis Childrenâ€™s Academy of Florida, we are excited to offer
            ballet classes as part of our diverse range of activities. Our
            ballet program is designed to introduce children to the graceful art
            of ballet in a fun and supportive environment.
          </p>
          <p>
            While we currently offer ballet classes, we are actively searching
            for more activities to enhance our program and provide additional
            opportunities for your children to enjoy and explore. In the past,
            we have offered karate classes, and we continue to seek out a
            variety of enriching activities to ensure a well-rounded experience
            for all our students. Stay tuned for updates as we expand our
            activity offerings.
