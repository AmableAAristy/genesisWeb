          <p>
            In addition to our core programs, Genesis Childrenâ€™s Academy of
            Florida proudly offers comprehensive before and after school
            services for children under 12. Our aim is to support working
            families by providing a safe, enriching environment where children
            can start and end their school day with engaging activities,
            homework assistance, and positive social interactions. We are
            committed to ensuring every child feels welcome and supported
            throughout their time with us.
